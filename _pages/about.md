Currently, I am a Process Engineer in Global Products Group at Lam Research, working on designing high throughput processes for synthesis of novel thin film materials. Prior to this, as a Ph.D. Candidate at UC Berkeley my dissertation focused on thermodynamic and transport modeling of electrolyte solutions. I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Chemical Engineering from IIT Delhi, India, where for my masters thesis I developed new mathematical tools to improve efficiency of CFD models for packed bed reactors. These diverse experiences ranging from process modeling to experimental design have given me a deep understanding and appreciation of engineering fundamentals, as well as the ability to work across teams. 

In my current role as a Process Engineer one of my main focus is identify and screen new processes for commercially feasibly manufacturing of thin films with desired properties. This not only involves evaluating chemical reagents to get the desired products but also requires controlling the reactions by optimizing process conditions. To achieve this, I combine experimental and modeling strategies for fast process optimization. A key criteria in the entire screening process is smooth integration of the new process with existing processes in semiconductor manufacturing. As a member of the Product group, I also regularly interact with Lam's customers to understand their needs and how these needs fit into broader business strategy of Lam Research.

During my Ph.D., I developed a statistical thermodynamics based theory to model electrical double layers for concentrated electrolytes. We provide an expression for electrochemical potential and solvation-free energy of the ions, both in the bulk and at the interface. Using this new theory we have quantitatively captured interfacial tension between coexisting vapor and liquid phases in ionic fluids and the reversal of ionic current in charged nanochannels. For my master's thesis, I worked in a chemical reaction engineering group focused on modeling flows through packed bed reactors. I used a combination of Voronoi tessellation and Minkowski tensors to mathematically characterize pore scale features of packed beds. These features were then to be incorporated in fluid flow equations to improve the predictive power of reactor models. On similar lines, I spent a summer at IMFT, Toulouse, France, working on image processing and pore network modeling to understand mechanism of water boiling in nuclear reactors. From my undergraduate days, I also have year long experience in design and development of catalysts and their characterization.

Additionally, I am trained in modern statistical techniques crucial for efficient design of experiments and complex process optimization. As an intern at the Flatiron Institute, NYC, I performed Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to model protein assembly. In Summer of 2024, I worked on probabilistic machine learning methods at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. My goal was to develop a Gaussian process regression model for thermodynamic free energies. Such advanced regression models can model a process with minimal number of data points and fast forward process optimization compared to traditional JMP models. In this regard, I have done also multiple courses on machine learning and statistics at UC Berkeley as well as NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute.
